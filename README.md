# PCT-Practice
Some of the programs in graph (BFS and DFS) are not completely done. some of the scenarios not covered, whoever is interested can clone this project and add the code for scenarios that I did not cover, though I have written the comments, where should one can add the code for uncovered scenarios.

In Graph Pacakge, GraphBasicOperation is having the main method, so to see the functionalities, one should run that file and the logics are implemented in other classes.
